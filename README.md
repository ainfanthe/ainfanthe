### About
Philo-polymath student in computer science and systems engineering, extremely willing to the elucidation of problems, to learning, study and interest in various branches or areas of human knowledge: my own existence is reduced to a simple accessory, means by which I conduct myself when understanding supposes to be the substantial.

- > Modified mantra: basta el espacio de una l√°pida para contener, encuadernada en musgo, abreviada mi futil existencia
