### Hello!

Computer Science and Systems Engineering student, I trace my path towards gardens and sinuous paths to the summit of my career: that stony as well as icy halcyonic peak, raised above clouds of strong cold air; I face obstacles with tenacity that stand in my way. I weave a symphony of instructions that breathe life into colorful machines and intricate systems. I sculpt innovative and ingenious solutions for complex difficulties. `const name = 'Felipe'; Developer dev = new Developer(name); while(dev.isCoding()) { dev.drinkCoffee(); }`
