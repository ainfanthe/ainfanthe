### printf("Hello!\n");

Computer Science and Systems Engineering student. I weave a symphony of instructions that breathe life into colorful machines and intricate systems. I sculpt innovative and ingenious solutions for complex difficulties. I have a lot of hobbies, but not a lot of free time. Always looking to learn new things.
